 Making tables in RStudio is a very useful skill to have. One of the most user
 -friendly packages for making these tables is called xtables, which can be used to 
 create many different types of tables to input data into. Learning how to dynamicall
 y connect your statistical results the tables in your thesis helps to save time 
 because if you find possible errors in your analysis it is easy once you have fixed 
 your analysis to have the change reflected within your tables.
               
Xtables is one of the most user-friendly packages because of the fact 
that the language for creating these tables is very straight forward. Like most 
things within LaTeX the tables must be within a environment. There are two environmen
ts in which xtables can be created in LaTeX the first of them being the `tabular` 
environment. You begin the xtable environment like any other with the begin command, 
`\begin{tabular}{table_spec}`. `{table_spec}` is probably not something you have seen 
before, but it is simply where you define your columns. For example if I wanted three 
columns the first of which was left aligned and the last two were center aligned my 
begin line would be written as `\begin{tabular}{l c c}`.  If you want to have 
straight lines to be your dividers for the columns you simply place a vertical bar 
{|} between each of the letters in your table spec, you do not have to have a 
vertical line between each of them, you only have to place it where you would like 
there to be dividers. Once you have created the outline for your table you can start 
to add your data which is a very simple process. Within the tabular environment you 
created all you have to do is start typing your data, to move from column to column 
you use the ampersand symbol {&} and to move to a new row you would use two backslash 
symbols {\\}.  If you would also like to have lines between your table rows you 
simply have to add a \hline command after the two back slashes. It is a good idea 
when adding your data to start each row on a new line so that you can easily find 
mistakes if they occur.  After you have added all your data you want to make sure you 
end the environment with an `\end{tabular}` command.


Once your table is completed you may want to help define exactly where you would want 
your table to appear on the page. This can be done by placing your tabular environmen
t within a table environment which has a position specification. The table environmen
t would look like this `\begin{table}[position_spec]`.  There is three options for 
your position spec, placing a t within the brackets places your table at the top of 
your page, a c will place your table at the center, and a b will place it at the 
bottom. As always you want to make sure that you end your table environment, with 
`\end{table}` but also make sure that you end the table environment only after  you 
have ended your tabular environment. If you do not use the table spec option, LaTeX 
will automatically place your table for you, which may not place it where you would 
like it.


Knowing how to create tables where you input your own data by hand is helpful, but 
the most dynamic part of tables in LaTeX with R is the fact that you can connect your 
research and analysis to your creation of the tables. This simply means that if 
something in your analysis changes, your table will change too without you having to 
go manually fix it. First you want to make sure that the class of the analysis that 
you are using is supported by `xtable` this can simply be done by typing `methods{xta
ble}` into your R console, this will return a list of classes that are supported by 
`xtable`. Once that you ensure that your analysis is supported you can use a r  code 
chunk to include the results within your thesis. Within your chunk you want to make 
sure that `results = ‘asis’`. This simply allows `LaTeX` to include the formatted 
table created by `xtable`. The next option you need to make sure is in your code 
chunk header is `echo=FALSE`, this hides the code that is needed to create your table 
from being shown. Once the header of your chunk is created you need to make sure that 
you load the library xtable, with the `library(xtable)` command.  When this is done 
then you are free to begin the code that will create your table. The command that you 
will use is `xtable(“name of analysis”)`, this is the most basic of ways to create 
the table. There are other option commands you can add within the bracket that define 
things such as the title, or number of digits to include for the numbers on the table
. Once this is done, as long as  you make sure that your analysis is saved within 
your thesis project, any time you analysis is updated as long as you recompile your 
thesis, the table will update too.




If the type of analysis that you want to use is not supported by `xtable` there are 
three simple steps that can help you to get around this problem, the first of which 
is to find the information that you want to include in the table and extract it from 
your unsupported. From there you want to convert this information into a data frame 
or matrix that will be supported by `xtables` but also present your information the 
way that you would like it. In some cases this can be done as easily as taking the 
summary of your analysis and using the selector icon ($) to extract the exact data 
you want represented, and then assigning that data to a specific name. From there it 
is extremely simple to use the `xtable` command that will create your table, and also 
update as you change things using the same methods described above.
