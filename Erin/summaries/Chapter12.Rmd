Chapter 12- Large LaTeX Documents: Theses, Books, and Batch Reports
Erin Kreiling
========================================================

- In order to create a large document, you should segment the markup file into individual chapter or section files and bring them all together when you compile the whole document. 
- You should take advantage of LaTeX and knitr to separate markup files into manageable pieces. 
- The manageable pieces are called child files, which are combined using a parent document.

12.1 Planning Large Documents
- If your presentation markup files are difficult to navigate, they are difficult to reproduce.
- The parent document is like the skeleton that organizes the children in a specific order.
- The parent document includes the preamble and all of the loaded, necessary LaTeX packages. 
- When you compile the parent document, you compile the entire document.
- The preamble only needs to be in the parent document.
- It is a good idea to store your child files in a subdirectory of the folder storing the parent file. 

12.2 Large Documents with Traditional LaTeX
- The input command is used where we want the child to show up.
- The tableofcontents will automatically create a table of contents.
- LaTeX makes it easy to include lists of figures and tables with the captions, table, figure, listoffigures, and listoftables commands.
- The clearpage command inserts a blank page before an item.
- You can automatically create an index using makeidx. 

12.3 knitr and Large Documents
- knitr's parent-child options allow us to include knittable children in documents and knit each child document separately. 
- The child command includes child documents within knitr.
- You can continue to use input and include within child code chunks.
- Use the set_parent command to specify where the parent file is.
- You can also use set_parent with Sexpr.
- knitr's parent-child functions work in any markup language.

12.4 Child Documents in a Different Markup Language
- In knitr, you can use the Pandoc program to convert child documents written in a different language into the primary markup language.
- The engine option set to 'bash' or 'sh' calls Pandoc directly from your parent document.
- -f markdown and -t latex tell Pandoc to convert the document from Markdown to LaTeX syntax.

12.5 Creating Batch Reports
- Batch reports subset a data set into multiple pieces and use these pieces as the input for knitr code chunks in different presentation documents for each subset of the data set. 
- The brew package is great for creating batch reports. 
- knit_expand can also create batch reports.
- brew has more capabilities than knit_expand.
- Text in a brew template document is printed as is when we brew it unless it is between brew's delimiters.
