Chapter 8- Statistical Modelling and knitr
Erin Kreiling
========================================================

8.1 Incorporating Analyses into the Markup
- The include command sets what text should be included in your final document.
- The eval command sets whether or not the code chunk will run.
- The echo command can hide a chunk's code.
- The tidy command uses the formatR package to clean up code.
- The results command shows the code, but not the results.
- The warning, message, and error commands can hide warnings, messages, or errors.
- The cache command runs the code chunk once and the output for when you knit the document again.
- The \texttt command converts text to the typewriter font.
- \Sexpr shows the results of R code in your knitr LaTeX produced text.
- R code included inline with Sexpr is evaluated using current R options.
- To include static code inline in an R Markdown document, enclose the code in single backticks.

8.2 Dynamically Including Modular Analysis Files
- You may want to run code stored in analysis files located on your computer.
- The source command allows you save code to a file and then retrieve it.
- Once you start collaborating with others, you should switch from sourcing to Dropbox.
- The devtools package helps with sources from secure URLs.

8.3 Reproducibly Random: set.seed
- The set.seed command specifies the random number generator you are using.

8.4 Computationally Intensive Analyses
- The cache chunk option and makefiles make it easier to include computationally intensive analyses. 
- If the code chunk you want to cache creates many objects, but you only want to save a few of them you can use cache.vars.
