Commands start with a backslash (\\)\n  - Arguments are written inside curly braces ({})\n  - If your command doesnt have an arguement you do not need the curly braces \n  - http://www.ntg.nl/doc/biemesderfer/ltxcrib.pdf is a place where you can find a comprehensive list of LaTeX commands \n- Preamble and Body\n  - All LaTeX documents have to have a preamble \n  - Ususally starts with documentclass command \n  - The percent sign is LaTeX's comment character \n      - Specifies what type of artcile you are making LaTeX refers to them as classes \n  - You can add options to document class that change the enitre format of the document\n      - \\documentclass[twocolumn]{article} would give you an artcile with who columns \n  - You can also use the preamble to specify other style options and load any other packages you may want to use \n       - Most of the packagaes that you will want to use will already downloaded when you download TeX unlike R \n  - When your preamble is complete you must use the \\begin{document} command to set the correct enviroment \n  - The very last line of the document should be \\end{document}\n  - It is also a good idea to include _knitr_ chunks in the preamble that set things such as global chunk options \n  - It is a smart practice to use the title, author, and date commands right after the document begins \n       - Right after all that information has been added you use the \\maketitle command to display it \n  - \\\\ Force a new line in LaTeX \n  - The thanks command allows us to create a footnote for author  contact info that isnt numbered like other footnotes \n  - Headings\n       - There are many levels of sections\n       - section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph\n       - Headers are automatically numbered \n       - To have unnumbered headings write your command like this \\section*{Unnumbered Section}\n       - Chapter will create a new chapter\n       - part will create collections of chapters \n  - Paragraphs and spacing \n       - Add blank lines between lines to create paragraphs \n       - The tabs for the start of the parapgrahs are determined by the artcile class\n       - More blank lines does not mean more space you must use the vspace command to do that \n       - It is the same concept with horizontal spacing, extra spaces between words does not mean extra you the hspace command will need to be used \n  - Horizontal lines\n        - The hrulefill will create horizontal lines in the text of a document \n  - Text Formatting \n        - emph command for italics \n        - textbf for cold \n        - You and nest them inside each other to have both \n        - You can set the font size for the entire docuemnt by using it as an option in the documentclass command in the preamble \n        - To change the size of specfic text you use the {\\SIZE_COMMAND . . . } command, where you replace the SIZE_COMMAND with either Huge, huge, Large, large, normalsize, small, footnotesize, scriptsize, tiny. \n        - You can not directly enter letters wtih diacrtitics into LaTeX\n        - \\c{c} gives you a c with a cedilla \n        - \\'{a} govesa you an a with a accent \n        - Quotation marks are done with \n  - Math\n        - If you want to have math inline with your text you have to use the math syntax which is   \\( . . . \\) \n        - To have the math seperate from the text you place the math commands in square brackets instead \\[...]\\\n  - Lists \n        - In order to create bullet lists in R you have to use the itemize enviroment \n        - \\begin{itemize} starts the list \n        - \\item is what you use to signify where you want the bullet \n        - You need to use \\end{itemize} when you are done with the list \n        - Use enumerate to number instead of bullets \n        - You can use nesting to create sublists within lists \n  - Footnotes\n        - \\footnote{} is how to create a footnote, the information goes inside the curly braces \n        - LaTeX automatically numbers and formats for you  \n        \n**11.2: Bibliographies with BibTeX** \n- BibTeX bibliographies are stored in plain text files with th extention .bib\n- The sytanx for the citation looks like:  \n@DOCUMENT_TYPE{CITE_KEY,  \ntitle = {TITLE},  \nauthor = {AUTHOR},  \n. . . = {. . .}  \n}\n- CITE_KEY is the reference label you use to include that ciation in the presentation document\n  - The most common way of doing this is the authors surname and publication year\n- Authors   \n  - Multiple authors are sepereted by and \n  - BibTex assumes the last word for each author is their sure name \n  - To have multiple words as the surname enclose them in curly bracets \n- Each item entry must end in a commect except the last one \n- Including Citations in LaTeX documents \n  - To include citations from a BibTex file in your LaTeX document first use the bibliography command \n  - You can change the formatting of teh bibliograpy with the bibliograph style command \n      - Place this immedeately before the bibliography command \n  - Place the cite command in the documents text where you want to place a reference \n      - This is where you include your CITE_KEY information \n      - Square brackets can be used to add options to your citiation \n      - Multiple citations can be inlcuded by using a comma between them \n- Generating a BibTex file of R package citations \n  - use the citation command inside the code chunk\n  - _knitr_ package creates BibTex bibliographies for R packages if you use the write_bib command \n- You can include more than one bibliography in the bibliography command by placing a comma between them \n- If you place all the packages that you want into a character vector, you can run it through write_bib and create a .bib file that way  \n\n**11.3: Presentations with LaTeX Beamer**\n- The beamer class is a way you can make a slideshow in LaTeX\n- To create a beamer slideshow, set your documentclass to beamer \n- From there you start the document the same as  other classes \n- Individiual slides are created using the frame envrioments \n- Frame titles are make using frame title \n- Unfortunately you do not know until the document is compiled if you have put to much information on a slide \n- \\tableofcontents can be automatically created from section headings, and will be on its own page\n- List work the same way in beamer, but you have the added bonus of being able to determine how they appear\n  - After \\item enclose the number of the order you want it to appear in < -> ",
