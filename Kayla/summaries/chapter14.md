**Chapter 14: Conclusion**
========================================================
- Practice is the best way to improve your reproducible research
- The R and reproducible research communities are very helpful if you run into problems  

**Citing reproducible reserach** 
- It is hard to cite reproducible research because the research can change 
- One way to try and avoid these problems is a standard for citing created by Altamn and King
  - The quantitative data sets cited should be: 
      - Easibly understandable to readers
      - Very specifically identitfy the correct version of a set 
      - Make it easy to locate the and verify the data set 
  - To help to make sure the correct version is located some tips they added were 
      - A uniquie global identifier 
      - A universal numeric fingerprint 
      - Bridge service 

**Licensing your reproducible research**
- In the US and other countries, research including computer code made on the internet is automatically given copy right protection 
- This works against reproducible research
- The are many complicated ways to go about making it  better, one thing that was suggest is adding a general public licsene  

**Sharing your code in packages**
- _devtools_ package can make it so that you can share your work for others in R packages 
- To create a package, it is done through projects and choosing `package` from the `type` dropdown menu

**Project development: Public or Private**
- Using version control helps to avoid people from stealing your work
- Deciding if you want your research public or private should really be on a case by case basis 

**Is it possible to Future proof your Research**
- It is hard to future proof your research because of the fact taht software changes, and we have no way to predict just how much it will be changing 
- LaTeX is a program that is mostly furture proofed 
- Virtual machines incased on a cloud server is one way to go about future proofing but can be extremely complicated
